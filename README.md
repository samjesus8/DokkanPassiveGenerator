# Dokkan Passive Generator - By Sam J

## IMPORTANT

- This application is now discontinued and the repository will be archived
- We will be moving to a web-based generator and mobile app which does the same functionality as this application

## About
This Windows Application is an extension of the "Cooler" Discord Bot's Slash commands. It uses the same design but in a Windows Forms application format and not the Discord Slash commands which means it'll be more efficient than using the Discord Bot.

What this application does is allow users to make their own Dokkan passives and use them as if it was in the Real game. It will generate some stats such as ATK when doing a Super Attack, or DEF with support.

This is by no means a 100% replica of the IRL Dokkan game and is only meant to be used for experimental and fun purposes. Please do not treat this as Dokkan itself

## Follow the YouTube series
This whole application is being coded through a YouTube series by Sam.Jesus8, so make sure to watch it to get an insight on how Dokkan calculations work and get a 100% developer's view on how this application was created. For people aspiring to be developers, this is a good series for you as it involves C# Coding, WinForms and the Background to Dokkan and how Stats are calculated
