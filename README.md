# Dokkan Passive Generator - By Sam J

## About
This Windows Application is an extension of the "Cooler" Discord Bot's Slash commands. It uses the same design but in a Windows Forms application format and not slash commands which means it'll be more efficient than using the Discord Bot.

What this application does is allow users to make their own Dokkan passives and use them as if it was in the Real game. It will generate some stats such as ATK when supering, or DEF with Damage Reduction.

This is by no means a 100% replica of the IRL Dokkan game and is only meant to be used for experimental and fun purposes. Please do not treat this as Dokkan itself

For more information on the Usage of this application, please read the .md files in the "Help" folder of this Repository
